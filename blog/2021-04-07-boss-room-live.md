You [saved the date](https://unity.com/demos/small-scale-coop-sample), and now Boss Room is public and live!

The new Unity Multiplayer Samples Co-op release provides a Boss Room small-scale cooperative game sample project. It gives you a sample project with all project files and assets to run a multiplayer game for up to 8 characters to defeat enemies and a boss. It is built on top of the new experimental netcode library – designed to be used in its entirety to help you explore the concepts and patterns behind a multiplayer game flow.
