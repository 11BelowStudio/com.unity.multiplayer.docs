description: Learn about Unity MLAPI Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), with implementations for server-side ServerRpc and client-side ClientRpc.
---
Unity MLAPI provides a refactored Remote Procedure Call (RPC) which provides increased performance, significantly reduced boilerplate code, and extensibility for future-proofed code. MLAPI RPC includes `ServerRpc` and `ClientRpc` to execute logic on the server and client-side. This provides a single performant unified RPC solution, replacing previous MLAPI Convenience and Performance RPC.
