---
The  position and rotation of a [`NetworkObject`](../basics/networkobject.md) is normally only synchronized when that object is spawned. To synchronize position, rotation, and scale at realtime during the game, a `NetworkTransform` component is needed. `NetworkTransform` synchronizes the transform of the GameObject it's attached to. This replicates that data to all other players.

While `NetworkTransform` works out of the box for simple position synchronization, it is not a one size fits all solution. In case you experience stuttering with `NetworkTransform`, you can try enabling interpolation, increasing `Fixed Sends Per Second`, and decreasing `Thresholds` values.

:::tip
You can have multiple `NetworkTransform` components on child objects of your network object to synchronize individual positions of child objects.

## Extrapolation

When enabled, extrapolation estimates the time between when a tick advances in server-side animation and the update of the frame completes on the client-side. The game object extrapolates the next frame's values based on the ratio.

## Interpolation

Interpolation creates a smooth object transition by using two known, historical positions to predict an object's path during the interval between receiving and updating positional data for that object. This is a buffer for the network to sync between object input and rendering, and reduces object jitter or position snapping.

You can select the best interpolation algorithm for the `GameObject` you want to sync. However, you still need to [interpolate your authoritative objects](../learn/clientside-interpolation.md).

Our default interpolation algorithm is `BufferedLinearInterpolator`. This buffers values before making them available to the `NetworkTransform` value to update. `NetworkTransform` is able to accumulate jittered network values without affecting the transform state and then consume them at regular intervals.

You can set global buffering by using:

```csharp
NetworkManager.Singleton.NetworkTimeSystem.ServerBufferSec = 0.2f;
```

:::note
Use `BufferedLinearInterpolator` carefully to avoid excessive latency in your game! Although it will smooth transforms on jittery connections, it adds more latency to your transform updates.

When targeting mobile platforms, youâ€™ll want to use bigger buffer values while keeping interpolation times lower for platforms with more stable connections by keeping buffer time low.

### Implementing Interpolation for NetworkTransform

Use the `IInterpolator` interface to create your own custom interpolator and override the different interpolators in the `NetworkTransform` interpolator. The interpolator you implement must keep its own state and is given new values every time there are new values available to `NetworkTransform`'s `OnValueChanged`.

### Best Practices

To ensure all your objects are in sync, use the same interpolator with the same configuration for the same types of `NetworkTransform`.

For example, a car would be interpolated differently than a character. So your interpolator configuration should be the same for all cars, but you could use a different interpolator configuration for your characters walking around. Therefore, a car with 300ms of added latency (due to buffering) bumps with other cars at their same synced time, but another car at 100ms of buffering would be desynced.
