title: Getting Started with Multiplayer Networking
---

Multiplayer Networking includes features, APIs, and sample code projects to help you build multiplayer games in Unity. This sections helps you get started with general concepts and information to prepare for developing games. 

Before developing multiplayer games, we recommend you have a firm understanding of networking. If you are new to networking or would like to refresh your knowledge, see the following concepts:

* [High Level Terminology](../reference/glossary/high-level-terminology.md)
* [Network Latency Management](../reference/glossary/network-latency-management.md)
* [Network Topologies](../reference/glossary/network-topologies.md)
* [Network Terms](../reference/glossary/network-terms.md)
* [Prioritization](../reference/glossary/prioritization.md)
* [Relevancy](../reference/glossary/relevancy.md)

Multiplayer Networking products, features, and services include:

* [Unity MLAPI](about-mlapi.md) is a high level networking library built for the Unity game engine to abstract networking and help you develop multiplayer games. 
* [Unity Transport](../transport/index.md) is a Unity package (`com.unity.transport`) to add multiplayer and network features to projects. It is completely separate from Unity MLAPI functionality and should not be confused with MLAPI Transport.
