There are many different architectures for creating multiplayer games. Your game can run on
dedicated servers like many esport titles do or connect clients directly and use a lockstep approach.
Finally many games allow a client to host a game and then other players to join that session.

Network topology defines the way a network is arranged, including how links and nodes relate to each other, clients and hosts, physical machines and virtual. Learn more about these configurations.

## Local or couch multiplayer

Using just client runtime 
Couch multiplayer games consist of local multiplayer games that can be played on the same screen, such as a TV, from one couch.

## Lan game (offline) 

Server and Client Runtime involved and transport, usually a hosted server on a site.

## Peer-to-Peer (P2P)

A peer-to-peer network is created when two or more PCs are connected and share resources without going through a separate server computer.

A P2P network can be:
- An ad hoc connectionâ€”a couple of computers connected via a Universal Serial Bus to transfer files.
- A permanent infrastructure that links a half-dozen computers in a small office over copper wires. 
- A network on a much grander scale in which special protocols and applications set up direct relationships among users over the Internet.
