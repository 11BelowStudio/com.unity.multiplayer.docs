title:  Introducing The Golden Path Series
description: Introduction the the GFolden Path series, explaining the undeerliying aim of the series and prividing links to the followon modules. 
---


In the Golden path series of tutorials we will build on the work we have already done in Hello World. We have made them modular so that you can work on the areas that interest you. Where possible we have minimised to steps that need to be repeated. While Golden Path initialy covers similar ground to the Hello World guides there are some minor differences so we will be starting afresh. You do not have to have completed either of the Hello World tutorials to complete this one, however, if you are new to Unity then we recommended that you  complete them in order to familiarise yourself with Unity. 

:::funfact
In the context of software or information modelling, a Golden Path (sometimes called happy path) is a default scenario featuring no exceptional or error conditions.
:::

We recommend that you start by following the Golden Path Foundation guide, then move on to the other modules which contain areas that interest you.
