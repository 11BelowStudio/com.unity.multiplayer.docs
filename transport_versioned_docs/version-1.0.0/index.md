title: About Unity Transport
---

The Unity Transport Package is Unityâ€™s next transport-level library. Also known as UTP, this package is netcode-agnostic, meaning it is intended to work with any netcode. 

The Unity Transport Package is responsible for abstracting platform-specific network socket libraries so that customized protocols for gaming can be utilized to send and receive network messages across the Wire, including having those messages be encrypted, guaranteed, and/or in-order.

The Unity Transport package is known as and listed in Unity as `com.unity.transport`.
