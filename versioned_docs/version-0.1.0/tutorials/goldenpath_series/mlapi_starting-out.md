title:  Learning with MLAPI Introduction
description: Introduction to the Golden Path series, explaining the underliying aim of the series 
---

These sections are intended to help guide you through the features of MLAPI, they will provide  examples of how MLAPI implements common  Multiplayer features. We will continue to add and update this section with more materials as we grow MLAPI.  

Normally the first program written by people learning to code is  Hello World . It is used as a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it. While we are not going to output the message "Hello World" we will be taking you through the same  basic steps that will let you check that you have installed MLAPI correctly and that you understand the fundemantals of using MLAPI.

:::unity
Becasue we dont print out "Hello World" it felt a bit of a cheat to call the initial introduction to MLAPI module Hello World" so we renamed it Golden Path. Some of the scripts still use the `HelloWorld` naming structure
:::

You should start by following the [GoldenPath Foundation Module](../../tutorials/goldenpath_series/goldenpath_foundation_module.md) then move on to the other modules which contain areas that interest you. Some of the modules are built on top of the Foundation Module others are stand alone. for those that are built on the Foundation Module we will recommend creating a clone of that project.

:::funfact
In the context of software or information modelling, a Golden Path (sometimes called happy path) is a default scenario featuring no exceptional or error conditions.

## Requirements
